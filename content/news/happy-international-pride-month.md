  June is here and it is queer! 

  We at THS Armada believe in everyone's right to be exactly who they are. We will therefore celebrate International Pride Month all month long in order to commemorate the milestones reached as well as the ongoing fight for LGBTQI+ rights.

Join the celebrations on our social media. Throughout the month you can learn more about how we at Armada work with diversity, quiz your own knowledge on the LGBTQI+ community and join us in celebrating everyone's right to be themselves!

Diversity is one of THS Armada’s core values and is integrated in everything we do. We believe that diversity is the foundation to a good organisation. Check out the [Diversity page](https://armada.nu/diversity) to learn more or reach out to our [Head of Diversity](https://armada.nu/contact) if you have any questions🏳️‍🌈
