We have our winners! All of the winners of the 2020 Armada competition have been contacted and as of this week we are sending out the prizes! A huge thank you to everyone who participated in the fair and made it the largest student organized digital fair this year!

We had a total of 2830 participants, and we awarded 34681 tickets! And it also proved to be quite an advantage to be active on the fair as the top 10% active students scored 40% of the lottery tickets.

Thanks again for your participation, and we hope to see you at Armada in the future!
