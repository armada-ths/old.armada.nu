### WE ARE BACK!

Welcome Exhibitor!

Speaking to different Armada exhibitors, I’ve noticed the difference it makes to work long term with student attraction. One exhibitor told me they’ve recruited someone who, 7 years after meeting the exhibitor at Armada, still says that the good impression they made at the fair is the main reason why he applied for the job. The impression you make on a student will be with them, and all their friends, their entire working life.

It is not easy to build such a strong brand with students. The students change completely every 5 or 3 years, the student world can look chaotic and disorganized and it can be hard to know where to look. Therefore we have created packages that give an easy way to leverage your Armada participation to maximize student connection this year. And if you want to talk more about building an effective long term strategy to reach students, I am only an email or LinkedIn connection away.

Welcome to Armada 2023!

### How do you succeed at a physical fair?

<br/>

We know that it can sometimes be overwhelming at a physical fair with a lot of people attending . Below are some tips from the Career Fair team on how you can increase your success at a physical Fair.

**Outstanding Booth:** The first thing the visitors see is your booth. See to it that it has all you want to convey in a subtle way. Luckily we are collaborating with Sture who are experts in exhibitions, they can bring all your booth ideas to life. Sture will initially reach out to all the exhibitors after the final registration. We encourage you to keep the correspondence in good flow to avoid last minute rush and changes to your booth.

**Timely logistical communication:** Armada has adapted a horizontal logistical solution to minimize its climate impact. This solution is called the Armada Transport. Our collaborator, DHL will take care of the transport of all our exhibitors to and from the fair . The booking of Armada transport will open after the final registration. To avoid any logistical mishaps, reach out to our contact at DHL in good time during the booking period.

**Visitor interaction:** Visitors are often shy to take the first step but a joyful smile from a company representative works wonders. Apart from that, you can prepare some tasks/ games at your booth that can work as icebreakers. These tasks also reduce anxiety among participants and make conversations easy.
