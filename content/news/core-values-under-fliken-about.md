## DIVERSITY

THS Armada wants to inspire students and companies on making their workplace inclusive. Therefore a special area called Diversity room, is set up in KTHB during the fair. Companies and organizations located here wants to emphasize the importance of inclusion and diversity.

THS Armada truly believe that the best teams are created where there is a focus on equality and diversity. To THS Armada, equal opportunities and equal values is fundamental. In the past, it was made possible for international students to be a part of the organization. Today, we also focus on gender balance within the teams of THS Armada.

## SUSTAINABILITY

We have chosen to dedicate an area of the fair with the purpose to match students with companies that are actively working with environmental sustainability. This area is called the Green Room, located in Nymble, and participating companies what to promote their development towards minimizing their environmental impact.
