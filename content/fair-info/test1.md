## Tips & tricks for luring students to your stand

Be happy! Make the students so interested in their futures that they forget that they just skipped class to stay and chat with you at the fair! Show off cool things at your stand area (but don’t forget the give-away policies or size of your stand area)! Arrange a treasure hunt! Instead of referring to the website of your organization, try to give the visitors direct answers or contacts (which feels more personal and inviting)! Strive for an including atmosphere!

There are many tricks to get the students to come and visit you at the fair. Try to plan some as a backup plan in case you at some point during the day feel that there isn't a good flow of visitors at your stand!

## Last note

Remember that the Career Fair Host is your contact to THS Armada. It is through this person you will extract information in the most efficient way.
