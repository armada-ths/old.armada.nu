# Diversity

<p><b id="diversity-color">Diversity</b> is one of THS Armada's core values. THS Armada truly believes that the best teams are created on the basis of equality, diversity and most importantly inclusion. It makes sense that equal value and opportunities are fundamental to our work. By actively working with this core value, THS Armada aspires to encourage students and companies to make their workplace inclusive. Diversity is promotes and featured in different kinds of events and concepts, which you can explore below. THS Armada’s Diversity policy can be found <a href="/assets/Diversity_policy_.pdf">here</a>!</p>

## **Diversity Room**

   One way THS Armada is accentuating the importance of diversity is through the Diversity Room, a special area at the career fair. As the fair is going digital this year, the diversity room will feature how Armada works with Diversity and also present information regarding the most progressive companies when it comes to inclusion and diversity in the workplace. These companies have been carefully selected with the Diversity Team, using a set of meaningful criteria developed by the team, called the Armada Diversity Index (ADI), found [here](/assets/Focus_rooms_selection.pdf).

   Visiting Diversity Room is a must if you’re interested in how some of the industry leaders work with diversity, what their culture is and which changes are happening right now in the working environment in regard to workers welfare. Stay tuned for upcoming information on some of the fun things the team is planning for the room, as well as a complete list of the exhibitors to be featured in the Diversity Room for THS Armada 2020.

## **Diversity Day**

   Diversity Day is another way to keep the discussion about equality issues going. The day takes place during the Event Week and consists of several events, where companies and students get a platform to talk about, discuss and engage in diversity practices. This year, Diversity Day will take place on Monday November 9th!

## Harassment policy

   It is important for us at THS Armada that everyone taking part in the career fair or events feel safe and enjoy their time. This is why we have developed guidelines to follow to make sure everyone’s boundaries are respected and all events go smoothly for everyone involved, within the THS Armada team as well as exhibitors, representatives, partners and attendees.
