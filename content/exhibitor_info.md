### How do you succeed at a physical fair?

<br/>

We know that it can sometimes be overwhelming at a physical fair with a lot of people attending . Below are some tips from the Career Fair team on how you can increase your success at a physical Fair.

**Outstanding Booth:** The first thing the visitors see is your booth. See to it that it has all you want to convey in a subtle way. Luckily we are collaborating with Sture who are experts in exhibitions, they can bring all your booth ideas to life. Sture will initially reach out to all the exhibitors after the final registration. We encourage you to keep the correspondence in good flow to avoid last minute rush and changes to your booth.

**Timely logistical communication:** Armada has adapted a horizontal logistical solution to minimize its climate impact. This solution is called the Armada Transport. Our collaborator, DHL will take care of the transport of all our exhibitors to and from the fair . The booking of Armada transport will open after the final registration. To avoid any logistical mishaps, reach out to our contact at DHL in good time during the booking period.

**Visitor interaction:** Visitors are often shy to take the first step  but a joyful  smile  from a company representative works wonders. Apart from that, you can prepare some tasks/ games  at your booth that can work as icebreakers. These tasks also reduce anxiety among participants and make conversations easy. For the first time this year, we will be having an Armada Competition at a physical fair. The competition is designed to attract more students to your booth in search of the great price. Read more about the competition in the Additional Services Catalogue.
