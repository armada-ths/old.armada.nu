Monday 20th of October 13:00-19:00, we recommend you to install your exhibitor area. Synchronize your date and time of arrival with your career fair host. The host will then be able to show you where your exhibition area is located. In exceptional cases, you may install your exhibition area on early Tuesday morning 21st of October. Any exhibition area that is not installed before 09:00 this day will not be provided equal assistance. 

During deconstruction of the fair, you will deconstruct your own exhibition area with limited assistance from your host. Before leaving the area, assure that all your cargos are properly documented and that your shipping adress is correct. Do not leave the area until this is done. Note that this information only concerns the consignments using Armada Transport (i.e larger consignments than one can carry to the car)
