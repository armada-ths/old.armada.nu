Armada Run is a 2.5 kilometer relay race at KTH Campus that really opens the opportunity to challenge the co-workers of your future. The event is arranged in favor for the Baltic Sea – the sign-up fee directly contributes to a more sustainable water environment. After finishing the race, we will stand ready with goodie bags, prizes to the top 3 runners and companies to mingle with. Do you want to run in a team? Perfect! Just sign up together with your friends, your chapter or an organization.

The first 100 to sign up for the event will receive a very special goodie bag. [Register here](https://ais.armada.nu/fairs/2018/events/1/signup) no later than October 14.

If you have any questions, don't hesitate to contact us at <mailto:support@armada.nu>.
