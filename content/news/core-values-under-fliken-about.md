## DIVERSITY

THS Armada truly believe that the best teams are created where there is a focus on equality and diversity. That means, equal opportunities and equal values are fundamental in our work. In the past, it was made possible for international students to be a part of the organization. Today, we also place focus on gender balance within the teams of THS Armada.

THS Armada wants to inspire students and companies on making their workplace inclusive. Therefore a special area, Diversity room, is set up in KTHB during the fair. Companies at Diversity Room place emphasis on inclusion and diversity in the workplace.

## SUSTAINABILITY

THS Armada has been climate neutral since 2015 and our belief in a green future motivates us to continuously make improvements towards a more sustainable fair. This year we proudly announce that the events, fair and banquet of THS Armada exclusively serve vegetarian food and that all events are eco events.

THS Armada has dedicate an area of the fair to companies and organizations that are actively working on being environmentally sustainable. This area is located in Nymble and named Green Room. Participants in Green room can present their work on minimizing the environmental impact.
