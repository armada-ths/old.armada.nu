THS Armada is a unique opportunity for exhibitors to market themselves to students at the biggest technical university in Sweden.

We create opportunities outside of the fair for our exhibitors to engage with and recruit students through interactive events, customized events and a banquet dinner amongst other activities.

Our vision is to allow every student to meet their dream employer and give companies the possibility to find their next star.
