# Become a Partner
Do you want your brand or products to be seen by thousands of future engineers? Do you want to help students find their future career path and be associated with Scandinavia's largest student driven career fair? The Armada sponsorship team will help you find the perfect branding opportunity for your company. Some of the possibilities include:

* Your logo and/ or message presented on the Armada website or on campus
* Have your products at our lounges or at our events
* Be a part of one of our short films
* Increased exposure on Graduateland (for exhibitors)

We also offer the opportunity to be a part of the Grand Banquet of THS Armada. This year, it is a banquet for everyone in Armada, as well as project groups from prominent universities in Sweden. An excellent opportunity for you to reach out to a broad audience of ambitious students!

A partnership with THS Armada will help you reach engineering, technology and architecture students at KTH, which is the highest ranked technical university in Sweden and among the top 100 in the world.
