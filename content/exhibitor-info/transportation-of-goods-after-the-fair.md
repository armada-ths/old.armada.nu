When the fair closes on the 21st of November you are responsible for packing your goods. Armadaâ€™s logistics team will provide bill of carriage. When you have packed your goods,  you leave your that at your booth area and the logistics team will hand it over to Ryska Posten. They will return it to you at a location and time decided in your earlier email conversation.
