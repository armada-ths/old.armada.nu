# WHAT IS ARMADA?

THS Armada arranges Scandinavia's largest career fair at KTH Royal Institute of Technology. Every year, more than 12,000 of Sweden's top engineering and architectural students flock to visit the fair to meet their future employers. Each year we strive to exceed their expectations and to give both students and employees the best possible chance to interact.

# CORE VALUES

**Diversity**, **sustainability**, and **quality** form the core values at the heart of this pursuit.

## Diversity

We are an organisation that truly believes the best teams are created when focusing on equality and diversity. We believe in everyone's equal worth and right to equal opportunities. Over the past years, this has been done through the integration of exchange students and a focus on gender balance within the teams of the organisations. This work has been very successful and has increased the competence within the organisation.

## Sustainability

THS Armada has been climate neutral since 2015 and our belief in a green future motivates us to continuously make improvements towards a more sustainable fair. We have chosen to dedicate an exclusive area of the fair with the purpose to match students with companies that are actively working with environmental sustainability. We call it the **Green Room**. With an eye-catching design, the area will stand out visually, drawing extra attention to every organisation who works hard to promote their work in the field of sustainability.

Another aspect of our sustainability work is our development of state of the art mobile and web technology. Our native [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=se.ths.kth.Aramda&hl=en) and [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/armada/id470187481?mt=8) applications include a matching algorithm for students to find suitable employers based on their field of study, interests and values.

## Quality

In 2017, we will put great emphasis on **matchmaking the right students with the right companies**. This will be done by including a matchmaking algorithm in our [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=se.ths.kth.Aramda&hl=en) and [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/armada/id470187481?mt=8) applications and through targeted marketing before and during the fair. Thus, we maximise the value you get from your THS Armada-participation.
