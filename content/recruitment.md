# Shape THS Armada

## THS Armada

In 1981, someone realised that students from KTH and their future employers needed a place to meet. And so they arranged the first ever Armada Fair. 39 years later, THS Armada has become the largest student driven project at KTH, annually attracting close to 200 organisations and 15 000 visitors through a number of events, a banquet and the beloved Armada Fair.

The Armada Team consist of KTH students and the THS Armada project continues until November 2020. It is an amazing opportunity for personal development, new friendships and experiences that you would not get in any class! The Armada Team is divided into four subgroups. Each subgroup works within separate areas, but all subgroups need to cooperate to create the Armada Experience. 

## Information

The application for the Operations Team 2020 will open soon! So if you feel like you want to be a part of the core team of THS Armada, contact Daniel Aston with your questions or book a fika at a@armada.nu.
