# Armada Competition 2021

## Short overview

Armada Competition is a gamification of the THS Armada career fair. The goal of the competition is to attract more students to sign up to the fair, encourage students at the fair to be more active, and to get students to participate in other Armada related events. By being interactive at the fair and signing up for events etc. a student earns tickets. These tickets are then raffled out at the end of the fair where the winners get prizes from companies and Armada. The more tickets a student has accumulated the greater their odds are at winning a prize. After a student has won a prize they are no longer in the running for the other prizes. A participant is automatically in the running to win a prize when they have earned a minimum of 25 tickets.

# Tickets

## What gives tickets?

There are a lot of different ways to earn tickets to Armada Competition. The bulk of the tickets are earned by being active at the fair. For a full breakdown of how the tickets are earned look at this [document](/assets/competition/tickets.pdf). On Graduateland a participant will earn points by:

* Filling out their profile
* Chatting with exhibitors
* Looking at Live Presentations
* Visiting exhibitor stalls
* Viewing available jobs

The fair also has a physical part hosted in Nymble. Inside Nymble participants of the fair can earn tickets by competing in the multitude of games available. 

Outside of the fair days a participant can also earn tickets by attending events hosted by Armada. A participant signs up to an event by going to armada.nu and registering. Tickets are only awarded to a participant if they show up at the event. During the event weeks there are also going to be days dedicated to Armada’s core values, Sustainability and Diversity. During these special days there will be multiple opportunities for a participant to earn tickets.

A participant can only win one time. After a participant has won, their tickets are removed from the raffle meaning they can’t win again. The prizes are raffled out starting from the highest monetary values going down to the lowest monetary values as determined by THS Armada. The first winner gets the first prize, the second winner gets the second prize and so on until no more prizes remain. 

## Announcement

Winners will be drawn live on Armada’s facebook in the middle of December (date to be announced).
