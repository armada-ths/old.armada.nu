### What is THS Armada?

THS Armada is a student-driven project at KTH Royal Institute of Technology that arranges the largest career fair in Scandinavia. Every year, more than 12,000 of Sweden's top engineering and architectural students flock to visit the fair to meet their future employers. The Fair is a two-day event with companies from all over the world.

This year we will repeat the success from last year with a virtual fair to make sure our exhibitors and vistors can connect in a safe way. In addition, we will build lounges at KTH where students can enjoy the virtual fair and still get the feel of a physical fair.

### Why THS Armada?

THS Armada is a unique opportunity for exhibitors to market themselves to students at the biggest technical university in Sweden. First and foremost through our fair but Armada is so much more. We create opportunities outside of the fair for our exhibitors to engage with and recruit students through interactive events, customized events and a banquet dinner amongst other activities. Our vision is to allow every student to meet their dream employer and give companies the possibility to find their next star.

Armada is an established event and this year will be the 40th Armada in a row. Students at KTH are constantly gazing into the future and we want to lead to bring them and your company together.

## Core Values

We at THS Armada believe that our core values Sustainability and Diversity are crucial for the workings of any organization. Therefore, we value that our exhibitors share our views and choose to highlight exhibitors that do. During our event weeks leading up to the fair, we have what we call Focus Days, one for each core value. During these days we invite companies that lead by example to host events such as lunch lectures, case events etc.

During the fair we will highlight companies that we believe share our core values. To learn more contact our [Head of Sustainability](mailto:saga.stugholm@armada.nu) or [Head of Diversity](mailto:anastasia.angeli@armada.nu).

<br />

## Events

Armada is more than a two day fair. If your company wants to host an event for KTH students, we are here to help. Why not present your company during a lecture, meet ambitious students during a case evening or mingle with your future employees at a relaxed AW?

### Banquet

Armada aspires to welcome your company to our Grand Banquet to celebrate the fair and to create a more relaxed environment to meet future employees. However, due to the current situation, it is yet undecided which form the banquet will take. The health and safety of our exhibitors and students is our main priority. We will be in touch with more information regarding the event and how you can proceed to purchase tickets for your company.

<br />

## Marketing

Let Armada help your company stand out and boost your employer brand. We offer many services for your company to reach the KTH students through our different social media. Market events or job offers through a post or share what a day at your office is like through an Instagram takeover. Reach out to our sales team to hear more about how your company can get seen by future employees.

<br />

### Armada Competition

Armada Competition is an incentive introduced during last year's fair to increase connections between students and companies. It was a big success and is therefore back this year. In short, students have the chance to win exclusive prizes by interacting with companies during the fair. Your company can participate with prizes to reach out in yet another way to the KTH students.
