In broad terms, the meaning of diversity is how any characteristics differentiates groups and people from one another. It means respect for and appreciation of differences in ethnicity, gender, age, national origin, disability, sexual orientation, education, and religion. We all bring with us diverse perspectives, work experiences, knowledge and cultures. In order for a diverse team to function the working environment has to be inclusive. Inclusion is a state of being valued, respected and supported. Itâ€™s about focusing on the needs of every individual and ensuring the right conditions are in place for each person to achieve its full potential.

We are an organisation that truly believes that the best teams are created when focusing on equality and diversity. We believe in everyone's equal worth and right to equal opportunities.Working with diversity brings efficient teams that includes members with different mindsets and perspectives. Our different viewpoints is what continuously develops and improves THS Armada as an organisation.

We at THS Armada hope that more students sees the benefits for working in diverse teams and that students value an inclusive and equal workplace. Armada also wants to make a solid foundation for a long-term work towards a more diverse organisation, where everybody has the same chance regardless of gender, age, sexual orientation, religious beliefs, culture, physical abilities or other individual difference.

We want to empathise the importance of diversity, inclusion and equal opportunities to affect and change the future work environment/ the industry. This is the reasons that we have created a room on the fair that focuses on Diversity called Diversity Room. THS Armada also arranges a panel discussion on Diversity.
