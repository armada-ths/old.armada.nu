# Information for Exhibitors

## TRANSPORT

This year Armada is proud to present the concept Armada Transport which includes free transportation (limitations apply below) of your goods to and from the fair. Your goods will be placed at your booth spot upon your arrival. The background behind offering this service is our aim to reduce Armada's impact on the environment and ensure a smooth exhibitor experience. We believe that it is more sustainable to have one transportation company transporting goods with a fewer amount of trucks driving on the road, rather than letting everyone find their own transportation solution leading to a higher climate impact with more trucks driving to KTH and more complex logistics.

Armada is happy to announce that we have hired DHL to handle the transportation. All of the administration of bookings will be handled directly by DHL. **Included in the Base kit are some free transportation options, which gives you the opportunity to choose one of the following options for transports within Europe to and from the fair without any extra costs:**

1. Two packages, maximum measures 150x50x50 cm each and maximum weight 35 kg each
2. One half pallet, maximum measures 60x50x150 cm and maximum weight 400 kg
3. One EUR-pallet maximum measures 120x80x200 cm and maximum weight 950 kg
4. One cage trolley maximum measures 120x80x200 cm and maximum weight 950 kg

All exhibitors who wants to send something bulky or more goods than what is included in one of the options above has to negotiate a price directly with DHL by filling in goods information in the linked booking PDF below and emailing it to DHL. They will then return with a price for transport. This will be billed directly by DHL to the concerning exhibitor. Please note that only bookings made through our Armada Transport form to DHL will be granted access to use the loading dock in the buildings on KTH Campus. This means you will not be able to hire your own transportation company unless you have the capability to carry your goods in by hand through the main entrance. This is due to strict limitations of space and accessibility in the fair buildings.
