**Armada Talks**

The goal and vision with Armada Talks is to inspire our visitors by inviting successful and inspirational speakers to share their stories and experiences while highlighting important topics such as our core values. This event is a part of the fair days with live audience and webb-TV. All speeches will be available live and on THS Armada’s channels. 

**Web-TV**

Livestream broadcasting is an area with much potential. We have created our own web-TV crew responsible for producing Armada Talks and other events connected to THS Armada. With livestream broadcasting, we are taking a step further with our digital platforms and get the opportunity to reach out to more people – even those who aren't able to visit the career fair.

**Printing**

Exhibitor material won't be possible to print at the fair. Find alternative ways to share information about your company/organization and in this way contribute to one of THS Armada's core values, environmentally sustainability.
