I would like to invite you and your organization to this year’s THS Armada, the annually held career fair at KTH Royal Institute of Technology. The two fair days begin with exciting events prior to the large fair, which will be held on the 19th - 20th of November 2019.

Every year, more than 12,000 of Sweden’s top engineering and  architectural students visit the fair to interact and connect with future employers. THS Armada is a great opportunity for you to provide information and long-term knowledge of your organization among KTH students, while creating personal contact with future recruitments and increasing the campus awareness of your organization.

We truly believe that a value driven organization increase the engagement and performance, both internally and externally.

**Diversity:** We believe that when you put different mindsets together, real change happens. We believe in a organizational culture of diversity and inclusion. Our fair and organization represents all students at KTH and everyone has the right to equal opportunities. We encourage all participating organizations to look at all talented students at KTH.

**Sustainability:** Our belief in a green future and a sustainable workplace motivates us to continuously make internal and external improvements towards a more sustainable fair. And world.
