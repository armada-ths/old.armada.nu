## WHAT IS ARMADA?

1981 - 2017

THS Armada is a part of the student union THS and is the largest student driven project at KTH Royal Institute of Technology. The fair was first organised in 1981 and has been a recurring event at KTH ever since. The project involves more than 300 students and aside from the fair, THS Armada arranges several events and a banquet, all to give you the best possible chance of finding your dream employer.

## CORE VALUES

**Diversity**, **sustainability**, and **quality** form the core values at the heart of this pursuit.

* Diversity

  We are an organisation that truly believes the best teams are created when focusing on equality and diversity. We believe in everyone's equal worth and right to equal opportunities. Over the past years, this has been done through the integration of exchange students and a focus on gender balance within the teams of the organisations. This work has been very successful and has increased the competence within the organisation.

* Sustainability

  THS Armada has been climate neutral since 2015 and our belief in a green future motivates us to continuously make improvements towards a more sustainable fair. We have chosen to dedicate an exclusive area of the fair with the purpose to match you with students that prioritise exhibitors that are actively working with environmental sustainability. We call it the **Green Room**. With an eye-catching design, the area will stand out visually, drawing extra attention to every organisation who works hard to promote their work in the field of sustainability.

  Another aspect of our sustainability work is our development of state of the art mobile and web technology. Our native [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=se.ths.kth.Aramda&hl=en) and [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/armada/id470187481?mt=8) applications include a matching algorithm for students to find suitable employers based on their field of study, interests and values.

* Quality

  In 2017, we will put great emphasis on **matchmaking you with the students you are interested in.**This will be done by including a matchmaking algorithm in our [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=se.ths.kth.Aramda&hl=en) and [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/armada/id470187481?mt=8) applications and through targeted marketing before and during the fair. Thus, we maximise the value you get from your THS Armada-participation and helping you in your branding and recruitment processes.
