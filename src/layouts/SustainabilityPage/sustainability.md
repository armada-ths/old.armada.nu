# Sustainability

   <p> <b id='sustainability-color'>Sustainability</b> is one of the key elements required in making the world a better place, a place where humanity and nature can live together in harmony without depleting the resources of nature. At THS Armada sustainability is a fundamental of all operations as it is one of our core values, together with Diversity. We reach out to a large scale of people and believe that with this comes a responsibility to encourage a more sustainable living. The THS Armadaâ€™s Sustainability policy can be found below. </p>
