Armada Run is a 2.5 kilometer relay race at KTH Campus that really opens the opportunity to challenge the co-workers of your future. Create your team of 4 and challenge your friends and our participating companies. Are you just two in a team? Attend anyway and share the laps among you. Every team runs a total of 10 kilometers. The event is arranged in favor for the Baltic Sea – the sign-up fee directly contributes to a more sustainable water environment. After finishing the race, we will stand ready with goodie bags, prizes to the top 3 teams and companies to mingle with. Do you want to run in a team? Perfect! Just sign up together with your friends, your chapter or an organization.

[Register here](https://ais.armada.nu/fairs/2018/events/1/signup) no later than October 14. If you have any questions, don't hesitate to contact us at <mailto:support@armada.nu>.
