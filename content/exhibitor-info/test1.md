## Transport to the fair

**Using external delivery firm:**

All exhibition material that is transported using an external  firm, should be delivered to our transport partner's warehouse.

  Delivery address: *Förlängda Armen,Passadvägen 10, 177 70 Järfälla*. Reference: *THS Armada*

  The warehouse would like to receive everything on 13th and 14th of november.  Goods that have not reached the warehouse before afternoon on the 15th of November might not make it to the fair in time.

* The goods will be sent in a common transport to KTH to reduce the number of trucks driving on campus at the same time. It’s of highest importance that the reference THS Armada is added on your orders to minimize the risk of goods getting lost on the way.

* If you have large items that requires special transport, please contact Niclas Bassili no later than 27th of October.
