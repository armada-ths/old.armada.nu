## DIVERSITY

We want to inspire students and companies to create a more inclusive workplace. Therefore, we have an exclusive area at the fair called Diversity Room located in KTHB. Companies and organizations placed in this area wants to emphasize the importance of inclusion and diversity.

THS Armada truly believes that the best teams are created when there is a clear focus on equality and diversity. We believe in everyone's equal value and the right to equal opportunities. In the past, this has been accomplished through the integration of international students at THS Armada. Furthermore, we place emphasis on gender balance within teams of the organization.



## SUSTAINABILITY
