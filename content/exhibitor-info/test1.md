Armada transports goods to and from the fair and our transport partner this year is Ryska Posten AB. New for this year is that the transport is included in the Base Kit for all exhibitors. The purpose with Armada Transport is to make the fair experience as smooth as possible, while reducing the number of trucks at the fair. Your goods will be transported to the fair at KTH, so that when you and colleagues arrive on the 19th of November to set up your booth, your goods will be placed at your booth area.
