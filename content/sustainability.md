Sustainability is one of THS Armada’s core values. We believe that sustainability is one of the key concepts in making the world a better place, a place where humanity and nature can live together in harmony without depleting nature’s resources. THS Armada’s Diversity  policy can be found here:

**Climate compensation**

This year, THS Armada offers the participating companies to climate compensate for their visit. The climate compensation is done by either investing in sustainable projects in developing countries, or by planting trees. The emission calculations are based on transportation of participants and goods, waste, food use and energy usage. The companies that climate compensate their visit through THS Armada will receive a climate compensation symbol during the fair.

**Eco labeling**

As an organisationen, we want to reduce our environmental impact as much as possible.Therefore, each year THS Armada strives to be certified as an Eco-labeled event by the KeepSweden Tidy Foundation. The certification process challenge us to improve our environmental impact in many different areas.We proudly present that the THS Armada career fair 2019 is labeled as an Eco event!

**Green Room**

THS Armada has dedicated an area of the fair to companies that we deem to be the frontrunners in our vision for a sustainable future. This area is called Green Room. The exhibitors in Green Room are eager to share their work in regards to minimising their environmental impact. Visiting Green Room is a must if you’re interested in sustainability, the sustainability field or if you want to know how different companies can work with sustainability.
