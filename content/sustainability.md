## Sustainability
  <img alt='' id='logo' src='/assets/sustainability-melon-nolabel.png'/>

  <p> <b id='sustainability-color'>Sustainability</b> testing is one of the key elements required in making the world a better place, a place where humanity and nature can live together in harmony without depleting nature’s resources. It
  is because of this that Sustainability is in the core of our operations. THS Armada’s
  Sustainability policy can be found </p>

## Green Room

  THS Armada has dedicated an area of the fair to companies that we deem to be the
  frontrunners in our vision for a sustainable future. This area is known as the Green Room. The
  exhibitors in Green Room are eager to share their work in regards to minimising their
  environmental impact. Visiting Green Room is a must if you’re interested in sustainability, the
  environment or if you just want to know how different companies can work with sustainability.

  Exhibitors in Green Room 2019 and the reasoning for having them in the room can be found here:

## Climate Compensation

  This year, THS Armada offers the participating companies to climate compensate for their visit.
  The climate compensation is done by either investing in sustainable projects in developing
  countries, or by planting trees. The emission calculations are based on transportation of
  participants and various flows associated with goods, waste, food use and energy usage during
  events as well as the career fair. The companies that climate compensate their visit through
  THS Armada will receive a climate compensation symbol during the fair on the Armada website. We are climate compensating through Klimatkompensera.nu.
