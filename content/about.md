# WHAT IS ARMADA?

THS Armada arranges Scandinavia's largest career fair at KTH Royal Institute of Technology. Every year, more than 12,000 of Sweden's top engineering and architectural students flock to visit the fair to meet their future employers. Each year we strive to exceed their expectations and to give both students and employees the best possible chance to interact.

<b>Diversity</b> andÂ <b>sustainability</b> form the core values at the heart of this pursuit.

## Diversity & Sustainability

We at THS Armada believe that Sustainability and Diversity are crucial for the workings of any
organization. Hence, our two core values include Sustainability and Diversity. You can read
