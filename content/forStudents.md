# Virtual THS Armada 2021

Welcome to THS Armada 2021 - a virtual fair mixed with physical lounges. 
The fair will take place at the virtual platform [Graduateland](https://event.armada.nu/sv/event/5150?fbclid=IwAR3jFscNx0HHvsyzGGhac5F1nR74ONKVffxtfivbQZuTwgu2b12-NYriQ64) and in addition we will build student lounges in Nymble where you can hangout and attend the fair. In our lounges we will offer spaces for you to sit down at and attend the virtual platform as well as getting company merch, fika and all the other great stuff that we all miss from a physical fair.

In short, THS Armada 2021 will be the best of both worlds!

## How to attend the virtual fair

The fair will be hosted on a platform called [Graduateland](https://event.armada.nu/sv/event/5150?fbclid=IwAR3jFscNx0HHvsyzGGhac5F1nR74ONKVffxtfivbQZuTwgu2b12-NYriQ64). Here you log in and create an account listing your experience, education and interests. After that you are ready to network. Visit all the exhibitors booths where you can learn more about the company, check out job opportunities or connect with the company representatives. We are all different and therefore you can choose to connect via chat or video call, whatever suits you the best. 

Based on your profile our exhibitors can also choose to reach out to you directly. So make sure your profile highlights all your goals and interests.

During the fair there will also be live presentations and other happenings on the platform. The best way to make sure not to miss anything is to follow us on [social media](https://www.instagram.com/thsarmada/), where we will post the schedule and make sure to remind you of all the fun. 

<p>For more info on how to set up an account and attend the fair, see <a href='/faq'>FAQ</a>.
And donâ€™t forget to visit Armada in Nymble!</p>
