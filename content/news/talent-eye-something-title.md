**THS Armada do more than 500 interviews each year to find the right candidates for the right positions. Result from teamwork, thoughts about organizational values and how your dream team looks like, is just a few things that shows up on our interviews. We have talked to Talent Eye, the company behind our methods and knowledge in interview technique. **

2011 was the first year that the team members in THS Armada got education in recruitment and interview methods. As the largest student driven organization in Scandinavia with over 260 engage students, we spend a lot of time and focus on finding the right candidates. Talent Eye have given us the tools we need to each year improve the organization. 

Tobias Porserud graduated from KTH 2011 and felt that there was a gap between students and the industry, and decided to change that. Tobias is Co-founder and CEO at Talent Eye, a recruitment company with focus on building bridges between gifted students and companies through customized internships and trainee programs. 

> \- An interview is a chance for honest dialoge - not an interrogation, says Tobias. To sit in a room with the feeling of a cross-examination lamp pointed at you just makes the interview uncomfortable and you will probably not perform the best version of yourself. Instead, as a recruiter, have an interview as you have a conversation. Nevertheless, it's essential to have a thoughtful structure and to base the questions on specific goals of your organization.

> \- All candidates that have applied for THS Armada gets offered an interview, so we do not do a pre-selection for the interview part. Once all the interviews are done, we have selection meetings with all the teams within the organization were we go through all the candidates that have applied. We base our decision in their personal traits and engagement rather than previous experience, and also how the candidates share our organizational values, says Charlotte Hedlund, Head of Human Resources at THS Armada.

**Talent Eye put a lot of focus on personal values and finding student's sweet spots - where they enjoy being and at the same time perform their very best. Everything to make the perfect match between the student and the employee.**

> \- We focus on the students on an individual level and try to get to know them and what they value. Through research it is proven that is an individual's personal values correlates with the organization's values - the results improved engagement and higher performance - and that is what we strives for.

> \- Two years ago, there was a lot of focus on your personal characteristics in generalized examples. This year, it was more focus on how one work in team and situation based questions. It was also clear in the interview that THS Armada is driven by their organizational values, I got questions like "this is our core values, how can Armada work further with them?". More time to discuss and talk about values, says Karolina Lind, Lounge Host for this year's career fair and earlier Lounge Host, 2016 and Event Host, 2015. 

Talent Eye have been a major key in THS Armada's development towards a more professional organization. Sharing their knowledge and practical tools through workshops and support has not only created larger engagement within the project, but also contributed to our social sustainability were each team member has the same tools, methods and information.
