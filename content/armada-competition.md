# Lottery principles

## Tickets awarded

After the closing of the fair, Armada will calculate for each participant how many points he or she has earned. Each point will equal 1 ticket in the competition.

## Raffling tickets

When the number of tickets is determined the winners will be raffled out. This will be done digitally with an randomize algorithm. Each participant can only win one time. Therefore, after winning one prize, the rest of the students' tickets will be consumed. The prizes will be raffled in order of monetary value as determined by Armada. So the prize with highest monetary value will be awarded to the first winner, the second highest value prize to the second winner and so on.

## Announcement

The winners will be contacted by email or by phone. After being contacted, the winner has 7 days to collect the prize per Armadas instructions if nothing else is agreed upon. If the winner fail to respond within 7 days from receiving an email from Armada, Armada has the right to draw another winner.

How the prizes are given to the winners depend on the prize and will be determined by the winner and Armada when contact is established.

# Prizes

## Ranking

The prizes will be ranked by Armada according to market value where prize number 1 is the prize with highest market value.

## Sponsored prizes

**Volvo Cars**

Volvo cars sponsor the Armada competition with one weekend with a rented Volvo car from Volvo Studio Stockholm, of a value between 1800 and 4000kr depending on which car the student chooses. This prize comes with the added requirement that the winner must have a driver's license. If the winner does not have a driver's license, he or she will be awarded the prize that is directly below it in the ranking. Then the prize will be offered to the next winner.

Additional conditions apply and Volvo Cars says the following:

*“The winner is asked to contact Volvo Studio minimum one week prior to the desired rental date - this in order to make sure that your car is ready and available on your desired weekend. In order to make use of this offer, you need to have a driver’s license valid in Sweden. You will also be asked to sign a rental agreement with Volvo Studio when you pick up the car. The car is covered by insurance and you as a driver is responsible for driving it in a careful way. Any potential damage to the car caused by the user will be covered by the driver.”*
