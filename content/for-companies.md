<h2>FOCUS ROOMS</h2>
At THS Armada, we believe in Sustainability and Diversity as our core values. Students at KTH feels very passionate about
these topics and consider them essential when choosing potential employers. To showcase our commitment, we've created
Focus Rooms for companies that share our values of sustainability and diversity. These rooms will receive extra marketing
attention and be highlighted during the fair. Additionally, we're organizing Focus Days where these companies can hold events
with increased marketing opportunities. We're excited to provide a platform for companies who prioritize sustainability and
diversity and look forward to promoting these values together.
