**Our perspective on diversity**

In a diverse work environment, it is essential to respect and appreciate differences in ethnicity, gender, age, physical abilities, sexual orientation, education and religion amongst individuals of the organisation. We all contribute with diverse perspectives, experience, knowledge and culture. A fundamental precondition for diverse teams to function is that of an inclusive work environment. Inclusion is a state of being valued, respected and supported. It's about focusing on the needs of every individual and ensuring that the right conditions are in place for each person to achieve their full potential.

**Why does THS Armada focus on diversity?**

We are an organisation that truly believes that the best teams are created when focusing on equality and diversity. We believe in the equal value of each individual, and their right to equal opportunities. Embracing diversity engenders efficient teams, facilitating the work of people with different mindsets and perspectives. Our belief in regards to our core values, is the very foundation upon which we develop and improve THS Armada as an organisation.

We at THS Armada hope that more students see the benefits of working in diverse teams, and that students come to value an inclusive and equal workplace. Furthermore, Armada strives to establish a solid foundation enabling a long-term endeavour towards a more diverse organisation. An organisation where everybody has the same opportunities, regardless of gender, age, sexual orientation, religious beliefs, culture, physical abilities or other individual differences.

**What is Diversity Room?**

We want to emphasise the importance of diversity, inclusion and equal opportunities in order to influence and change the future work environment and the industry as a whole. This is the reason for the Diversity Room initiative, an exhibition area at the fair that focuses on diversity. In connection to Diversity Room, THS Armada arranges a panel discussion, with the intent of highlighting questions regarding diversity and how companies work with it.

Diversity Room is an area at the fair where you, as students, can find inspiration from companies that work with Diversity. These companies know that Diversity is a business strategy that increases innovation and knowledge.
