## Competition Description

<br /> <br />

### Short overview

Armada Competition is a gamification of the THS Armada career fair.  The 2022 edition of the Armada competition seeks to be bigger and more interactive for both the exhibitors and the visitors, being a physical fair. The goal of the competition is to encourage students at the fair to be more active, and to get students to participate in other Armada-related events. By being interactive at the fair a student earns tickets. These tickets are then raffled out at the end of the fair where the winners get prizes from companies and Armada. The more tickets a student has accumulated the greater their odds are of winning a prize. After a student has won a prize they are no longer in the running for the other prizes. A participant is automatically in the running to win a prize when they have earned a minimum of 30 tickets  during the fair. New for this year is that the companies will also be battling it out in 3 categories of which two are voted in by the students.

Our own IT team has developed a new web solution just for Armada Competition. Students and participating exhibitors will have to register on the platform for them to take part in the Competition. [ **Stay tuned for the Launch of the Competition latest one week before the Fair!**]

## How It Works

<br />

### Student Registration

For you to take part in the competition you have to be a KTH student and register your complete profile on this page. After registration, you will be able to log in and validate yourself to get tickets for the draw. You will be able to see your ticket and a map of the companies taking part in the competition while logged in. 

Playing is easy, you only need to check where the participating exhibitor is in the map. Do their challenge at the booth and scan the validation code they show you when you are done. You will be able to see your points on the dashboard! Note that you will be prompted to answer two simple questions about your experience at each exhibitor booth. This will then be used for the company awards!

## Tickets

<br />

### What gives tickets?

There are a lot of two ways to earn tickets to the Armada Competition. The bulk of the tickets is earned by being active at the fair. The ticket distribution will be as below: 

#### Before the fair
* Armada competition Registration -10-point ticket  

#### During the fair
* Visiting and doing an activity with  a participating company booth during the fair - 3-point ticket/ company  and Day
* A company can offer you a 10-points ticket for exceptional performance at their booth, so bring your A-GAME! 

Note that you can take part in all activities during the fair without taking part in the competition which means you do not need the armada competition registration if you do not want to take part in the competition.

### Personal data

The Information collected during the registration of  profiles is only used for the sole purpose of the competition. This information together with any other information collected via google forms is handled by THS Armada and follows GDPR. 


<br />

### Raffle

After the fair is over tickets from all the different activities are calculated and combined. The raffle is done digitally with the Mersenne Twister Pseudorandom number generator. Pseudocode can be found [here](/assets/competition/Pseudocode_Armada_Competition.pdf). A participant can only win one time. After a participant has won, their tickets are removed from the raffle meaning they can’t win again. The prizes are raffled out starting from the highest monetary values going down to the lowest monetary values as determined by THS Armada. The first winner gets the first prize, the second winner gets the second prize and so on until no more prizes remain.


<br />

### Announcement

Winners will be drawn live on Armada’s Facebook in the beginning of December **(date to be announced)**. All winners will be contacted by email and have 7 days to claim their prize per Armada’s instructions if nothing else is decided. If a winner fails to respond within 7 days Armada has the right to draw another winner. How prizes are given out depends on the prize and will be decided together with the winner over email.
