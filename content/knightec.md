# FROM NEWLY GRAD TO ROLE MODEL

On November 9th at 15.00-16.15, THS Armada and Knightec invite you to a digital event. Take the chance to meet role models within the field of engineering and ask your questions.

During this event, you will meet several KTH alumni with an inspirational career who will share their journeys. Our guests have had a wide range of jobs from CEO, CTO, Board Director to Sustainability Manager, and worked across the globe in smaller companies to larger ones such as Spotify. You will get the chance to pick who you want to listen to, but all speakers will be recorded so that you can listen to as many as you want afterward. Our guests will share their stories and best tips for the future. There will also be time for you to ask questions, so take the opportunity to learn from and connect with some of the best KTH alumni! 

To finish up, Sigbritt Karlsson, principal of KTH will share some words of inspiration for the future.
