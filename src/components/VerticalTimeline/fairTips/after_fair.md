# After the fair
How to stay in touch with companies/company representatives after the fair? 
Initiated chatts will still be active for some time after the fair. 
All unanswered chats will exceed in an email reminder. You can also continue the conversation over email (a bit uncertain about this one, need to double check). 
Connect via LinkedIn 

Make sure to summarize after the fair. 
What were you impressed by? 
Any interesting companies to keep track of? 
Should I make any changes in my studies? Recommended courses etc
