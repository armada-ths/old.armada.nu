<b id="sustainability-color">Sustainability</b> is one of the key elements required in making the world a better place, a place
where humanity and nature can live together in harmony without depleting nature’s resources. It
is because of this that Sustainability is in the core of our operations. THS Armada’s
Sustainability policy can be found

## **Green Room**

THS Armada has dedicated an area of the fair to companies that we deem to be the
frontrunners in our vision for a sustainable future. This area is known as the Green Room. The
exhibitors in Green Room are eager to share their work in regards to minimising their
environmental impact. Visiting Green Room is a must if you’re interested in sustainability, the
environment or if you just want to know how different companies can work with sustainability.
Exhibitors in Green Room 2019 and the reasoning for having them in the room can be found

## **Climate compensation**

This year, THS Armada offers the participating companies to climate compensate for their visit.
The climate compensation is done by either investing in sustainable projects in developing
countries, or by planting trees. The emission calculations are based on transportation of
participants and various flows associated with goods, waste, food use and energy usage during
events as well as the career fair. The companies that climate compensate their visit through
THS Armada will receive a climate compensation symbol during the fair on the Armada website. 

## **Eco labeling**

As an organisation, we aspire to have as low an environmental footprintas possible. Therefore,
THS Armada strives to be certified as an Eco-labelled event by the Keep Sweden Tidy
Foundation year after year. The certification process challenges us to reduce our environmental
impact in many different areas. You can read more about the Keep Sweden Tidy foundation

We proudly present that the THS Armada career fair 2019 is labelled as an Eco event!
