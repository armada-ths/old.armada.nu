### What is THS Armada?

THS Armada is a student-driven project at KTH Royal Institute of Technology that arranges the largest career fair in Scandinavia. Every year, more than 12,000 of Sweden's top engineering and architectural students flock to visit the fair to meet their future employers. The Fair is a two-day event with companies from all over the world. 

This year we will repeat the success from last year with a virtual fair to make sure our exhibitors and vistors can connect in a safe way. In addition, we will build lounges at KTH where students can enjoy the virtual fair and still get the feel of a physical fair.

### Why THS Armada?

THS Armada is a unique opportunity for exhibitors to market themselves to students at the biggest technical university in Sweden. First and foremost through our fair but Armada is so much more. We create opportunities outside of the fair for our exhibitors to engage with and recruit students through interactive events, customized events and a banquet dinner amongst other activities. Our vision is to allow every student to meet their dream employer and give companies the possibility to find their next star. 

Armada is an established event and this year will be the 40th Armada in a row. Students at KTH are constantly gazing into the future and we want to lead to bring them and your company together.

## Core Values

We at THS Armada believe that our core values Sustainability and Diversity are crucial for the workings of any organization. Therefore, we value that our exhibitors share our views and choose to highlight exhibitors that do. During our event weeks leading up to the fair, we have what we call Focus Days, one for each core value.  During these days we invite companies that lead by example to host events such as lunch lectures, case events etc.

During the fair we will highlight companies that we believe share our core values. To learn more contact our [Head of Sustainability](mailto:saga.stugholm@armada.nu) or [Head of Diversity](mailto:anastasia.angeli@armada.nu).
