Armada Run is a 5 km race close to KTH and really opens the opportunity to challenge the co-workers of your future. The event is arranged together with EY and Run of Hope, a collaboration between Vitamin Well and Childhood Cancer Foundation. After finishing the race, we will stand ready with goodie bags, prizes to the top 3 runners and companies to mingle with. Do you want to run in a team? Perfect! Then register together with friends, chapter or organization.

The first 100 to sign up for the event will receive a very special goodie bag. [Register here](https://ais.armada.nu/fairs/2017/events/20/signup) no later than 10th of October 23:59.
