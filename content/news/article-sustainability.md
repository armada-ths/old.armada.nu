One of our biggest challenges as students entering the industry is how we can create better conditions for the environment than in the past. The future depends upon that the society and industry changes to environmental friendly processes and perspektive.

We at THS Armada want to make our impact on the environment as small as possible.

Be apart of our long-term commitment of becoming more environmentally sustainable. Participate in Green Room to enlighten these questions and inspire students and organisations to become more environmentally friendly.

Enlighten these questions and inspire students and organisations. One way of doing that is by making an area at the fair that will be called Green Room.

**What is Green Room?**

A climate compensated area at the fair placed in a beneficial spot where a lot of students walk by. The area will visually stand out with an eye-catching design, drawing extra attention to your organization.

During the year we will continuously work towards a more sustainable organization, and use our social media channels, website and applications to enlighten this work along with drawing attention to our Green Room. The area will get extra exposure and further marketing, making sure that your environmental work stands out.
