Hello and welcome to THS Armada 2022! This year, the THS Armada fair returns as a physical fair to bring exhibitors and students closer together. Come by to see our all-new exhibitions, booths and presentations. We are bringing back the fair in style, with a new colourful array of exhibitors in Nymble over two days. Make sure not to miss anything! 

A new edition of the Armada Competition will be returning this year! The popular competition will be available throughout the fair days. To take part, gather tickets by completing tasks at our exhibitorsâ€™ booths to win prizes in our live Facebook raffle! Find out more on the competition page (https://armada.nu/armadacompetition).
