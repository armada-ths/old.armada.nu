# Shape THS Armada

The Armada team consists of KTH students and the THS Armada project continues until November every year. It is an amazing opportunity for personal development, new friendships and experiences that you would not get in any class!

The Armada team consists of around 250 people and is divided into four subgroups:

   <p><b id='sustainability-color'>Logistics & Fair</b>: Armada is a large career fair. As we often like to point out, the largest in Scandinavia! The logistics and fair team makes sure that the Armada fair happens and that it runs as smoothly as possible. </p>

  <p><b id='sustainability-color'>Business, Relations & Event</b>: This group knows people and planning. From putting on a magical night at the yearly banquet to organising all the other events leading up to the fair. Have you heard we offer lunch lectures, the Armada run and many more exciting events?</p>

  <p><b id='sustainability-color'>Marketing & Communication</b>: Marketing, building a brand, social media. The MC team makes sure Armada gets seen and talked about. Not to mention they make sure all the important information about the fair reaches all our 12 000 visitors. They are also in charge of recruiting all the 250 people within Armada.</p>

  <p><b id='sustainability-color'>IT</b>: Web, internal systems, you name it. These folks know IT all!</p>

******************
So, how is all this organised?

Think of the Armada team as a big circle.

<p><b id='sustainability-color'>Project Manager: </b>In the center we have the one and only Project Manager, PM. The PM is in charge and therefore also has the main responsibility for everything! The Project Manager position is recruited at the KårStyrelse election in October/November.</p>

<p><b id='sustainability-color'>Project Group: </b>Surrounding the Project Manager in the Armada circle we have the Project Group, PG. PG consists of about 20 people each Head of a division within the Armada team. The application period for the Project Group is during December/January and fully recruited in the beginning of February.</p>

<p><b id='sustainability-color'>Operation Team: </b>Further out in the circle we have the Operation Team, OT. All the different divisions within Armada have their own OT members working in teams to simply get everything done.  The Operation Team is recruited in april/may.</p>

<p><b id='sustainability-color'>Hosts: </b>Last but not least, surrounding everyone in the Armada circle we have the hosts. The hosts are the very backbone of Armada. As a host you can have different responsibilities ranging from being a company contact person to a photographer to being responsible for one of the many lounges during the fair. Hosts are recruited in the beginning of september.</p>

All in all, Armada consists of around 250 people all working together towards one goal, making Scandinavia's largest career fair greater than ever.
