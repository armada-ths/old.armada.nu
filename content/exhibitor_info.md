### TRANSPORT OF GOODS TO THE FAIR

Armada transports goods to and from the fair. Our transport partner this year is DHL. The purpose with Armada Transport is to make the fair experience as smooth as possible, while reducing the number of trucks at the fair. Your goods will be transported to the fair at KTH, so that when you and colleagues arrive on November 18th to set up your booth, your goods will already be placed in your booth.

Note that it is not allowed to arrange any own transportation with external carriers other than Armada Transport (DHL). In case you for some reason must have an exception from this rule then you need a written confirmation from Armada’s Head of Logistics ([filip.ryden@armada.nu](mailto:lukas.lindroos@armada.nu)) and your delivery must have recieved a time slot in advance specified in date/time. Any goods transported by external carriers will not be provided equal service as goods sent through Armada Transport.

In case you have something minor (eg small bags, boxes) which you don’t need transport aid for, then you also have the possibility to carry these goods by hand through the main entrance. It is not allowed to carry anything big and bulky since the entrances serves as emergency exits and the goods must not block these paths in case of emergency.
