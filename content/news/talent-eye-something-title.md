_Karolina Lind, Charlotte Hedlund and Tobias Porserud_

2011 was the first year that the project members in THS Armada got education in recruitment and interview methods. As the largest student driven organization in Scandinavia with over 260 engage students, we spend a lot of time and focus on finding the right candidates. Talent Eye has given us the right tools and is one of the reasons that we have developed into a professional organization. 

Tobias Porserud is CEO and founder of Talent Eye, a recruitment company with focus on building bridges between students and companies through customized internships. 

> \- We focus on the students on an individual level and really get to know them and what they value. It's proven through research that if an individual's personal value correlate with the organization's values - there will be full engagement from both parts and that is what Talent Eye strives for.
