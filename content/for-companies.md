<h3 id="how-do-you-succeed">How do you succeed at the fair?</h3>

<br/>

We know that it can sometimes be overwhelming at a physical fair with a lot of people attending . Below are some tips from the Career Fair team on how you can increase your success at a physical Fair.

**Outstanding Booth:** The first thing the visitors see is your booth. See to it that it has all you want to convey in a subtle way. Luckily we are collaborating with Sture who are experts in exhibitions, they can bring all your booth ideas to life. Sture will initially reach out to all the exhibitors after the final registration. We encourage you to keep the correspondence in good flow to avoid last minute rush and changes to your booth.

**Timely logistical communication:** Armada has adapted a horizontal logistical solution to minimize its climate impact. This solution is called the Armada Transport. Our collaborator, DHL will take care of the transport of all our exhibitors to and from the fair . The booking of Armada transport will open after the final registration. To avoid any logistical mishaps, reach out to our contact at DHL in good time during the booking period.

**Visitor interaction:** Visitors are often shy to take the first step but a joyful smile from a company representative works wonders. Apart from that, you can prepare some tasks/ games at your booth that can work as icebreakers. These tasks also reduce anxiety among participants and make conversations easy. For the first time this year, we will be having an Armada Competition at a physical fair. The competition is designed to attract more students to your booth in search of the great price. Read more about the competition in the Additional Services Catalogue.

<h3 id="what-is-ths-armada"> What is THS Armada? </h3>

THS Armada is a student-driven project at KTH Royal Institute of Technology that arranges the largest career fair in Scandinavia. Every year, more than 12,000 of Sweden's top engineering and architectural students flock to visit the fair to meet their future employers. The Fair is a two-day event with companies from all over the world.

During 2020-2021 we had two virtual fairs. But since last year we are back with a physical fair that spans all across KTH campus.
<a class="anchor" id="why-armada"></a>

<br />

<h3 id="why-ths-armada"> Why THS Armada? </h3>

THS Armada is a unique opportunity for exhibitors to market themselves to students at the biggest technical university in Sweden. First and foremost through our fair but Armada is so much more. We create opportunities outside of the fair for our exhibitors to engage with and recruit students through interactive events, customized events and a banquet dinner amongst other activities. Our vision is to allow every student to meet their dream employer and give companies the possibility to find their next star.

Armada is an established event and this year will be the 41st Armada in a row. Students at KTH are constantly gazing into the future and we want to lead to bring them and your company together. Welcome to THS Armada

<h2 id="core-values"> Core Values </h2>

We at THS Armada believe that our core values Sustainability and Diversity are crucial for the workings of any organisation. Therefore, we value that our exhibitors share our views and choose to highlight exhibitors that do. During our event weeks leading up to the fair, we have what we call Focus Days, one for each core value. During these days we invite companies that lead by example to host events such as lunch lectures, case events etc.

During the fair we will highlight companies that we believe share our core values. To learn more contact our [Head of Sustainability](mailto:cameron.kennett@armada.nu) or [Head of Diversity](mailto:niclas.mejia@armada.nu).

<br />

<h2 id="events"> Events </h2>

Armada is more than a two day fair. If your company wants to host an event for KTH students, we are here to help. Why not present your company during a lecture, meet ambitious students during a case evening or mingle with your future employees at a relaxed AW?

<br />

<h3 id="event-weeks-2023"> Event Weeks 2023 </h3>

THS Armada offers you a wide range of events to profile your organisation towards students who have a genuine interest in your company. During our event weeks, 31st Oct - 18th Nov, you will have the opportunity to show students what your company is like with a lecture or see them in action at a case evening. Maybe you’d like to join the Armada Run: race against students and show them that your organisation is the best! Or perhaps you’ll get the opportunity to present an event during our Focus Days, with the topics of interest being our Core Values: Sustainability and Diversity. To see all of the events we offer this year, make sure to look at the Event pages in our product catalogue and additional services catalogue.

Is something missing in our options? We also offer Custom Events designed in collaboration with your organisation and THS Armada to create an event tailored to your needs and wishes. Reach out to your sales representative to discuss! The possibilities are endless…

Armada would like to welcome you and your company to this year’s Grand Armada Banquet! The Grand Armada Banquet is an excellent opportunity for you to meet and mingle with students in a more relaxing environment. During the banquet you will enjoy a tasty three course meal and energising entertainment! The banquet will be held on the 22nd of November after the fair in Victoriahallen, Stockholmsmässan. Be sure to put on your high heels and tie your tie because this year’s theme is Las Vegas!

<br />

<h2 id="marketing"> Marketing </h2>

Let Armada help your company stand out and boost your employer brand. We offer many services for your company to reach the KTH students through our different social media. Market events or job offers through a post or share what a day at your office is like through an Instagram takeover. Reach out to our sales team to hear more about how your company can get seen by future employees.

<br />

<h3 id="armada-competition"> Armada Competition </h3>

Armada Competition is an incentive introduced during last year's fair to increase connections between students and companies. It was a big success and is therefore back this year. In short, students have the chance to win exclusive prizes by interacting with companies during the fair. Your company can participate with prizes to reach out in yet another way to the KTH students.
