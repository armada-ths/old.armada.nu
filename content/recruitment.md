# Shape THS Armada 2019

## THS Armada

In 1981, someone realised that students from KTH and their future employers needed a place to meet. And so they arranged the first ever Armada Fair. 38 years later, THS Armada has become the largest student driven project at KTH, annually attracting close to 200 organisations and 15 000 visitors through a number of events, a banquet and the beloved Armada Fair.

The Armada Team consist of KTH students and the THS Armada project continues until November 2019. It is an amazing opportunity for personal development, new friendships and experiences that you would not get in any class! The Armada Team is divided into four subgroups. Each subgroup works within separate areas, but all subgroups need to cooperate to create the Armada Experience. 

Armada is now recruiting Team Leaders and Coordinators to its Operations Team, the application is open Mon 1 April to Tue 23 April! 

The application for the IT team is closed.

Here follow short descriptions of the different areas of THS Armada:

**Business Relations & Events:** Builds long lasting relationships with businesses, arranges spectacular high quality events and a grand banquet for 600 people. This team is the core to all our contact with exhibitors and partners.

**Marketing & Communication:** The key to a successful project is great communication, both internally and externally. People need to know of our values, activities and the benefits they will have by participating. A successful Marketing & Communication team is key to a successful THS Armada.

**Logistics and Career Fair:** Creates the career fair experience through intensive planning and logistics. The final result is a two day career fair with 15 000 visitors which is the foundation of the relationship between students and exhibitors.

**IT:** In a digital era, the digitisation process is one of the core pillars of THS Armada. Turning creative ideas from all groups into reality enhances the Armada Experience for all members, visitors and exhibitors. The IT team is the key to make the world a better place.
